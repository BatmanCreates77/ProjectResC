```

## üí° Budget Optimization Strategies

### **1. Efficient Context Management**
- **One comprehensive upload** instead of multiple files
- **Reference previous context** in follow-up prompts
- **Build incrementally** on existing code

### **2. Smart Prompting Techniques**
```
Instead of: "Create a complete resume upload system with drag and drop, file validation, progress tracking, error handling, and mobile responsiveness"

Use: "Build resume upload: drag-drop + PDF parsing + validation using existing components"
```

### **3. Reuse and Reference**
```
"Add job scraping to existing project. Use current Prisma models and API structure."
```

### **4. Batch Related Features**
```
"Implement authentication + user management + usage tracking in one go"
```

## üéØ Development Phases (Budget-Conscious)

### **Week 1: Foundation (3-4 prompts)**
- Project setup + core architecture
- Authentication + database models
- Basic UI components with Radix

### **Week 2: Core Features (3-4 prompts)**  
- Resume upload + parsing
- AI analysis + domain detection
- Results display + basic dashboard

### **Week 3: Intelligence (2-3 prompts)**
- Job market scraping + analysis
- Salary insights + market trends
- Premium job link feature

### **Week 4: Polish (2-3 prompts)**
- Payment integration + feature gating
- Export functionality + optimization
- Testing + deployment setup

**Total Estimated Prompts: 10-14** (vs 25+ with inefficient approach)

## üìã Essential Environment Variables

```env
# Core Services
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."

# Optional (add later)
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL="..."
SENTRY_DSN="..."
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Command for Replit

**Upload the context file above, then use this initial prompt:**

```
Build ResumeOptimizer Pro based on the uploaded context. Start with:

1. Next.js 14 + TypeScript project setup
2. Radix UI + Tailwind configuration  
3. Prisma schema with all required models
4. Basic file structure for scalability

Generate package.json, prisma/schema.prisma, and core configuration files. Focus on production-ready architecture.
```

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

- **Setup Phase**: ~$10-15 (efficient prompts)
- **Core Development**: ~$25-35 (focused features)
- **Polish & Deploy**: ~$15-20 (optimization)
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $50-70 (vs $150+ with inefficient approach)

## ‚ö° Pro Tips for Replit Efficiency

1. **Always reference existing code** in follow-up prompts
2. **Batch related features** together
3. **Use "build upon existing project"** rather than "create new"
4. **Provide clear, specific requirements** to avoid back-and-forth
5. **Test incrementally** to catch issues early

This approach should get you a fully functional MVP within budget while maintaining code quality and feature completeness! üéØ
